			<p>Hi! I'm Tim. And I'm on a quest to become an expert Data Scientist.</p>
			<p> I'm learning and practicing how to use tools such
				as data wrangling, data visualisation, machine learning algorithms and computer programming to capture
				the past, and work out what it has to say about the future.</p>
			<p>I like discovering how things work, and why mysterious things happen. I also enjoy
				finding smart solutions to all sorts of problems. It's amazing what technology can achieve these days.
			</p>
			<p>I believe that with imagination, determination, faith, and a fairly nice plan; anyone can accomplish even
				their wildest dreams. Well... as long as said dreams are plausible of course.</p>
