			<p>Hi there!</p>
			<p>My name is Timothy Abwao, and I'm on a quest. I'm working on growing into a really good Data Scientist.
			</p>
			<p>I like explaining things, and crave to understand why things happen. It's amazing what technology can
				achieve these days; deriving insights with literally global impacts. I'd like to be a part of that.</p>
			<p>I believe that with determination, faith, imagination, and a fairly nice plan; anyone can accomplish
				great things - even their wildest dreams.</p>
