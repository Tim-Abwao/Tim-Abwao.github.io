	<p>Hi there. I'm glad you're here, another of the 8 billion or so of us I get to share a word or two with.</p>
	<p>My name is Timothy Abwao, and I'm a Data Analyst making strides towards becoming an expert Data Scientist.</p>
	<p>I spend most of my days brushing up on my Python skills, and learning new ways to distill insights from even the messiest of datasets.</p>
	<p>I like uncovering how things work, and discovering why mysterious things happen. This helps in finding the right, which in turn results in interesting revelations and innovative solutions to all sorts of problems</p>
	<p>This blog is meant to be a platform to share what I've found out so far, but it also serves as a powerful motivation to keep on studying new tools and practise more.</p>
	<p>I believe that with imagination, determination, faith, and a fairly nice plan; anyone can accomplish even their
		wildest dreams. Well... as long as said dreams are plausible of course.</p>
