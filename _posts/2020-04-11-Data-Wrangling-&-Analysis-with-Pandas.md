To quote directly from its website, *"pandas is an **open source** ... library providing **high-performance**, **easy-to-use** data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language."* It is also an essential dependency for most machine-learning libraries in Python.

## Installation

Pandas documentation includes [detailed installation instructions](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html) for various platforms. To install from Pypi, try:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Getting Started

If you're new it, pandas features the iconic [10 minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/10min.html) to walk you through how to perform some essential operations:

- Creating *series* and *dataframes*
- Selecting and viewing data
- Handling missing data
- Merging, joining and reshaping
- Importing and exporting files, among others.

Anyone having prior experience in another platform (e.g. R, SQL, SAS, STATA) can benefit from [this comparison with pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/comparison/index.html).

Browsing through the [extensive User Guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) and [cookbook](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/cookbook.html) helps learn advanced features and best - practices.

[This collection](https://github.com/Tim-Abwao/learning-pandas) of jupyter notebooks could also help you get started.

I'll expound on more of its fascinating features in the (hopefuly very) near future.
