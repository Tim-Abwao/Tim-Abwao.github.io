[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) is a popular [object-relational database management system](https://database.guide/what-is-an-ordbms) (*it stores data in relations/tables with rows and columns; and tables can be linked*). It is fast, reliable and open source (free). It can hold databases as large as 32TB, with virtually unlimited rows.

[Psycopg](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs) is a trusted and reliable Python adaptor for PostgreSQL. It enables one to connect to a PostgreSQL database and run [SQL](http://www.sqlcourse.com/intro.html) commands, right from within Python scripts.

Psycopg is very handy for applications written in Python that need to store and/or retrieve data in a PostgreSQL database e.g. flask/django websites & blogs, data analysis apps, report-generating apps, etc.

If you wish, you can explore some of Psycopg's features using [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Tim-Abwao/Psycopg2-Basics/blob/master/PostgreSQL%20Basics%20with%20Psycopg2.ipynb)
