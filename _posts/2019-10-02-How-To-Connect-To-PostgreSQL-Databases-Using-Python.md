[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) is a **fast**, **reliable** and **open source**(free) [object-relational database management system](https://database.guide/what-is-an-ordbms) (*it stores data in relations: which are really just tables with rows and columns*). It can hold databases as large as 32TB, with virtually unlimited rows. This makes it an ideal choice for many companies dealing with large volumes of data.

## Psycopg2 - Python's Vessel to Postgres
[Psycopg](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs) is a **robust** Python adaptor for PostgreSQL. It enables one to connect to PostgreSQL servers, create database and run various operations and [SQL](http://www.sqlcourse.com/intro.html) queries, right from within Python scripts. 

It comes in handy for applications written in Python that need to store and/or retrieve data in a PostgreSQL database e.g. flask/django websites & blogs, data analysis apps, report-generating apps, etc.
