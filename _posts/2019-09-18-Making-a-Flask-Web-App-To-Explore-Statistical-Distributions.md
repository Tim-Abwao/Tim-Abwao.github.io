[Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) is a "**lightweight... web app framework**" for Python. It is designed to be **simple** and basic; thus making it easy to learn, while simultaneously allowing experienced web developers the freedom to integrate custom/preferred features.

## Getting Started
Anyone with experience (or just interest) in Python and web applications can have a simple Flask app up and running in a matter of minutes with the help of the [Flask quickstart guide](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#quickstart), which introduces Flask's main features. 

Flask's documentation also features a [tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/#tutorial) with a step-by-step guide to building a blog.

Flask can make wonderful dynamic websites, and interactive applications; but this will require at least a fairly good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) can be a real help for absolute beginners.   

## Statistical Distributions App
[This](https://statistics-distributions.herokuapp.com) is a flask app designed to allow users to choose from among some common statistical distributions, and learn some basic facts about them. Please, go through the [Flask quickstart guide](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#quickstart), if you haven't yet. Afterwards, if you wish, you can run the app yourself. The code for the app is available 
[here](https://github.com/Tim-Abwao/statistical-distributions-flask).
