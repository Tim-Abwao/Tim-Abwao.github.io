[Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) is a lightweight framework for web app development in Python. It is designed to be simple and basic; which makes it easy to learn, while simultaneously allowing experienced web developers the freedom to integrate custom/preferred features.

Anyone with experience, or interest in Python and web applications can make and have a simple Flask app up and running in a matter of hours (even minutes) with the help of the [Flask quickstart guide](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#quickstart): which introduces Flask's main features. Flask's documentation also features a [tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/#tutorial) with a step-by-step guide to building a blog.

Flask can make wonderful dynamic websites and responsive applications, since it has Python running in the background. But this will require a fairly good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Absolute beginners will have the thrilling experience of 'learning as they go'. 

It'll be exciting discovering the ingenuity behind today's sophisticated and artistic websites. And there's an abundance of resources, such as [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com)(a personal favourite) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), to help along the way.   

I'll re-edit this page to add a step-by-step guide on how to build a flask web app to explore some common statistical distributions. But in the meantime, if you wish, you can view the live demo [here](https://statistics-distributions.herokuapp.com). The code for the app is available [here](https://github.com/Tim-Abwao/statistical-distributions-flask)
