[Demand forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_forecasting) is "a field of predictive analytics which tries to understand and predict customer demand" in order to "optimize supply decisions".

It has the potential to minimise, and even altogether eliminate the losses that result when perishable items spoil.

Perishable goods are, by definition, items that have a short shelf-life: things like vegetables, fruits, milk, meat and fish, among others. Some can last a few days, but some last merely a few hours.

Many grocery stores suffer loss when buyers pick only fresh items, leaving the rest of the 'stale-looking' ones to go bad. To curb such losses, some have lowered their stock to avoid leftovers; but this could backfire when customers fail to get what they want, and take their business elsewhere.

Even with innovative solutions such as advanced preservative packaging, cold-storage facilities, and the operation of in-house delicatessens to consume the stock, considerable amounts of perishables eventually go bad and have to be discarded. Demand forecasting can take this a step further.

There are plenty of software packages in the market today that utilise Time Series Analysis, Machine Learning and/or Simulation models to predict just the right amount of perishable goods to stock. Some can even factor in past trends and rapidly respond to expected ripples in the industry. 

If you wish, you can make your own demand forecasting model and try it out. It can be as simple as plotting graphs and performing simple linear regression, or even a really long script of complex computer code.
