[Demand forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_forecasting){:target="_blank"} "tries to understand and predict customer demand" so as to "optimize supply decisions". It has the potential to minimise, and even completely eliminate losses resulting from spoilt items.

Perishable goods are often defined as items that have a short shelf-life: things like vegetables, fruits, milk, meat and fish, among others. Some can stay fresh for only a few hours, but grocery stores and supermarkets have to keep them in stock and available to customers.

Many such businesses suffer loss when buyers pick only fresh items, leaving the rest of the 'aged' ones to go bad. A common tactic employed to curb this practice is the lowering of stock volumes, to avoid leftovers. But this badly backfires when customers fail to get what they want, and take their business elsewhere.

Even with modern innovative solutions such as advanced preservative packaging, cold-storage facilities, and the operation of in-house delicatessens to consume extra stock, considerable amounts of perishables eventually go bad and end up as garbage. Incorporating a demand forecasting mechanism can take this loss minimisation a step further.

There are plenty of software packages in the market today (e.g. [APO by SAP](https://blogs.sap.com/2015/09/27/sap-apo-general-overview/){:target="_blank"}, OracleÂ® Demantra, [GDMH Streamline](https://gmdhsoftware.com/demand-planning-software?utm_source=capterra){:target="_blank"}, [DynaSys](https://www.dys.com/demand-planning){:target="_blank"}, etc) employing tools such as Time Series Analysis, Machine Learning algorithms and Simulation models to predict just the right amount of perishable goods to stock. Some can even factor in expected ripples in the industry, and thus allow timely intervention. 

If you wish, (and have some experience or interest in computer programming languages) you can make your own demand forecasting model and experiment with it.
