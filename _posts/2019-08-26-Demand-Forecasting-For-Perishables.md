[Demand forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_forecasting) could be described as the use of [predictive analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics) to determine the **expected demand** for products or services.

It is mostly applied in industries with **volatile products**, and has the potential to minimise or even completely **eliminate losses** resulting from spoilt items.

## Perishables and their problems

Perishables are products that have a rather short shelf-life: vegetables, fruits, milk, meat, fish, and the like. Some can stay fresh for only a few hours. This presents unique challenges to wholesellers and retailers dealing with them.

In everyday life, people tend to pick only 'crisp-looking' produce, leaving behind the 'wrinkled' and the 'fresh but not good enough' items. Then time acts on the latter two and shrinks their value. At times, entire batches go bad.

A common tactic employed to curb the resultant losses is the lowering of stock volumes to avoid leftovers. But this often badly backfires when customers repeatedly fail to get what they want, and take their business elsewhere.

## Demand Forecasting to the rescue

Even with modern solutions such as advanced preservative packaging, cold-storage facilities, and the operation of in-house delicatessens to consume extra stock; considerable amounts of perishables still wind up as garbage. Is there a way to reliably tell the ideal inventory volume? Demand forecasting attempts to do just that.

There are plenty of software services available today (e.g. [APO by SAP](https://blogs.sap.com/2015/09/27/sap-apo-general-overview/), OracleÂ® Demantra, [GDMH Streamline](https://gmdhsoftware.com/demand-planning-software?utm_source=capterra), [DynaSys](https://www.dys.com/demand-planning), etc) that engage tools such as Time Series Analysis, Machine Learning algorithms and Simulation models to predict just the right amount of perishable goods to stock. Some can even factor in expected ripples in the industry, and thus allow timely intervention.
