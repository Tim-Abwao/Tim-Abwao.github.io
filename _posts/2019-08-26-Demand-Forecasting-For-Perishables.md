[Demand forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_forecasting) can be described as the use of predictive analytics to determine the **expected demand** for products or services. It is mostly applied in industries with **volatile products**, and has the potential to minimise or even completely **eliminate losses** resulting from spoilt items.

## Perishables and their problems
Perishables are items that have a rather short shelf-life: things like vegetables, fruits, milk, meat and fish, among others. Some may stay fresh for only a few hours. This presents a challenge to grocery stores and supermarkets, who still have to keep them in stock and available to customers.

Many agriculture - based businesses suffer losses when buyers pick only fresh items, leaving the rest of the 'wrinkled' or 'withered' ones to go bad. A common tactic employed to curb this behaviour is the lowering of stock volumes to avoid leftovers. But this often badly backfires when customers repeatedly fail to get what they want, and take their business elsewhere.

## Demand Forecasting to the rescue 
Even with innovative solutions such as advanced preservative packaging, cold-storage facilities, and the operation of in-house delicatessens to consume extra stock; considerable amounts of perishables still wind up as garbage - which begs the question: "Is there a way to reliably tell the ideal amount of inventory?" Demand forecasting attempts to do just that.

There are plenty of software services in the market today (e.g. [APO by SAP](https://blogs.sap.com/2015/09/27/sap-apo-general-overview/), OracleÂ® Demantra, [GDMH Streamline](https://gmdhsoftware.com/demand-planning-software?utm_source=capterra), [DynaSys](https://www.dys.com/demand-planning), etc) employing tools such as Time Series Analysis, Machine Learning algorithms and Simulation models to predict just the right amount of perishable goods to stock. Some can even factor in expected ripples in the industry, and thus allow timely intervention.
