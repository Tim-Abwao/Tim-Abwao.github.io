I"O<p><a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a> is a powerful, open source Natural Language Processing (NLP) software package built by <a href="https://explosion.ai/">Explosions AI</a>. It’s very handy for processing large volumes of text, and picking out information about the people/places/companies/etc mentioned. It also has wonderful text visualisation tools, demonstrated <a href="https://explosion.ai/demos/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some of it’s <a href="https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101#features">main features</a> include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tokenization:</strong> splitting text into pieces (i.e words, numbers, punctuation marks, etc) termed ‘tokens’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Part-of-Speech Tagging:</strong> classifying the tokens according to their <em>syntactic functions</em>, as nouns/verbs/conjunctions/determiners/etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Named Entity Recognition:</strong> getting the names, places, organisations, dates, events, landmark structures, nationalities, languages, etc. in the text. Please see <a href="https://spacy.io/api/annotation#named-entities">Named Entities</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> gives a positivity/negativity score of a phrase/sentence/document.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lemmatization:</strong> getting the root/base form of the tokens, without inflections for tense/plural/case/gender/ etc. This allows words like ‘was’ and ‘be’ to be interpreted as similar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dependency Parsing:</strong> getting the grammatical structure i.e relationships between the tokens in terms of ‘subject’ or ‘object’ in the given contexts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sentence Boundary Detection:</strong> getting the sentences in the text (grouping together tokens that make up individual sentences by identifying where sentences begin and end).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>and many more.</p>

You can get it <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/">here</a>, or you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">conda</code> instead)</p>

<p>Spacy has its very own <a href="https://course.spacy.io">Advanced NLP with spaCy course</a> that introduces and explains its various features; and even includes practice sessions to see them in action. It’s the best way to learn what spaCy is all about.</p>
