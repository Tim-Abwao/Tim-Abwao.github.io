I"<p><a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/">Flask</a> is a “<strong>lightweight… web app framework</strong>” for Python. It is designed to be <strong>simple</strong> and basic; thus making it easy to learn, while simultaneously allowing experienced web developers the freedom to integrate custom/preferred features.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>Anyone with experience (or just interest) in Python and web applications can have a simple Flask app up and running in a matter of minutes with the help of the <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#quickstart">Flask quickstart guide</a>, which introduces Flask’s main features.</p>

<p>Flask’s documentation also features a <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/#tutorial">tutorial</a> with a step-by-step guide to building a blog.</p>

<p>Flask can make wonderful dynamic websites, and interactive applications; but this will require at least a fairly good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a> and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> can be a real help for absolute beginners.</p>

<h2 id="statistical-distributions-app">Statistical Distributions App</h2>
<p><a href="https://statistics-distributions.herokuapp.com">This</a> is a flask app designed to allow users to choose from among some common statistical distributions, and learn some basic facts about them. Please, go through the <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#quickstart">Flask quickstart guide</a>, if you haven’t yet. Afterwards, if you wish, you can run the app yourself. The code for the app is available 
<a href="https://github.com/Tim-Abwao/statistical-distributions-flask">here</a>.</p>
