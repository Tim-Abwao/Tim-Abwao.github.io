I"ç<p><a href="https://spacy.io/">spaCy</a> is a <strong>powerful</strong>, <strong>convenient</strong>, open source <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> Python package built by <a href="https://explosion.ai/">Explosions AI</a>. It is excellent for quickly processing large volumes of text and picking out information about the entities (people/places/organisations/etc) present. It also has wonderful text visualisation tools, demonstrated <a href="https://explosion.ai/demos/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="linguistic-features">Linguistic Features</h2>
<p>Some of spaCyâ€™s <a href="https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101#features">main features</a> include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tokenization:</strong> splitting text into pieces (i.e words, numbers, punctuation marks, etc) termed â€˜tokensâ€™.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Part-of-Speech Tagging:</strong> classifying the tokens according to their <em>syntactic functions</em>, as nouns/verbs/conjunctions/determiners/etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Named Entity Recognition:</strong> getting the names, places, organisations, dates, events, landmark structures, nationalities, languages, etc. in the text. Please see <a href="https://spacy.io/api/annotation#named-entities">Named Entities</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> gives the positivity/negativity score for a phrase/sentence/document.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lemmatization:</strong> getting the root/base form of the tokens, without inflections for tense/plural/case/gender/ etc. This allows words like â€˜wasâ€™ and â€˜beâ€™ to be interpreted as similar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dependency Parsing:</strong> getting the grammatical structure i.e relationships between the tokens in terms of â€˜subjectâ€™ or â€˜objectâ€™ in the given contexts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sentence Boundary Detection:</strong> getting the sentences in the text (grouping together tokens that make up individual sentences by identifying where sentences begin and end).</p>
  </li>
</ul>
