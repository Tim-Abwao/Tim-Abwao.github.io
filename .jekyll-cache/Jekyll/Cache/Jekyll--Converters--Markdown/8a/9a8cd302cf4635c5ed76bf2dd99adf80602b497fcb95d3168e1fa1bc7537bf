I"'<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_forecasting">Demand forecasting</a> is “a field of predictive analytics which tries to understand and predict customer demand” in order to “optimize supply decisions”.</p>

<p>It has the potential to minimise, and even altogether eliminate the losses that result when perishable items spoil.</p>

<p>Perishable goods are, by definition, items that have a short shelf-life: things like vegetables, fruits, milk, meat and fish, among others. Some can last a few days, but some last merely a few hours.</p>

<p>Many grocery stores suffer loss when buyers pick only fresh items, leaving the rest of the ‘stale-looking’ ones to go bad. To curb such losses, some have lowered their stock to avoid leftovers; but this could backfire when customers fail to get what they want, and take their business elsewhere.</p>

<p>Even with innovative solutions such as advanced preservative packaging, cold-storage facilities, and the operation of in-house delicatessens to consume the stock, considerable amounts of perishables eventually go bad and have to be discarded. Demand forecasting can take this a step further.</p>

<p>There are plenty of software packages in the market today that utilise Time Series Analysis, Machine Learning and/or Simulation models to predict just the right amount of perishable goods to stock. Some can even factor in past trends and rapidly respond to expected ripples in the industry.</p>

<p>If you wish, you can make your own demand forecasting model and try it out. It can be as simple as plotting graphs and performing simple linear regression, or even a really long script of complex computer code. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting">This Kaggle competition</a> might be a great place to shop for insights.</p>
