I"ú<p><a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/">Flask</a> is a lightweight framework for web app development in Python. It is designed to be simple and basic; which makes it easy to learn, while simultaneously allowing experienced web developers the freedom to integrate custom/preferred features.</p>

<p>Anyone with experience, or interest in Python and web applications can make and have a simple Flask app up and running in a matter of hours (even minutes) with the help of the <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#quickstart">Flask quickstart guide</a>: which introduces Flaskâ€™s main features. Flaskâ€™s documentation also features a <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/#tutorial">tutorial</a> with a step-by-step guide to building a blog.</p>

<p>Flask can make wonderful dynamic websites and responsive applications, since it has Python running in the background. But this will require a fairly good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Absolute beginners will have the thrilling experience of â€˜learning as they goâ€™.</p>

<p>Itâ€™ll be exciting discovering the ingenuity behind todayâ€™s sophisticated and artistic websites. And thereâ€™s an abundance of resources, such as <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a>(a personal favourite) and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>, to help along the way.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll re-edit this page to add a step-by-step guide on how to build a flask web app to explore some common statistical distributions. But in the meantime, if you wish, you can view the live demo <a href="https://statistics-distributions.herokuapp.com">here</a>. The code for the app is available <a href="https://github.com/Tim-Abwao/statistical-distributions-flask">here</a></p>
