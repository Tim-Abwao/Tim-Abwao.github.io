I";<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> is a popular <a href="https://database.guide/what-is-an-ordbms">object-relational database management system</a> (<em>it stores data in relations/tables with rows and columns; and tables can be linked</em>). It is fast, reliable and open source (free). It can hold databases as large as 32TB, with virtually unlimited rows.</p>

<p><a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/docs">Psycopg</a> is a trusted and reliable Python adaptor for PostgreSQL. It enables one to connect to a PostgreSQL database and run <a href="http://www.sqlcourse.com/intro.html">SQL</a> commands, right from within Python scripts.</p>

<p>Psycopg is very handy for applications written in Python that wish to store and/or access data in a PostgreSQL database e.g. flask/django websites &amp; blogs, data analysis apps, report-generating apps, etc.</p>
